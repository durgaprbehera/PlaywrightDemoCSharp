Project Structure
Program.cs: The main file containing the script to automate the web interaction using Playwright.
Code Explanation
Here is a brief overview of what the script does:

Initialize Playwright and Browser: Creates an instance of Playwright and launches a Chromium browser with headless mode disabled.
Navigate to the Page: The browser navigates to a specified URL where the PDF link is located.
Handle File Download: Clicks the link to download the PDF and waits for the download to complete.
Save the File: Saves the downloaded PDF to the current directory.
Example Code
csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        await using var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions { Headless = false });
        var context = await browser.NewContextAsync();
        var page = await context.NewPageAsync();

        // Navigate to the page with the PDF link
        await page.GotoAsync("https://example.com");

        // Handle file download
        var download = await page.RunAndWaitForDownloadAsync(async () =>
        {
            await page.ClickAsync("a#pdf-link"); // Replace with the actual selector for the PDF link
        });

        // Save the downloaded file
        var filePath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "downloaded.pdf");
        await download.SaveAsAsync(filePath);

        Console.WriteLine($"PDF downloaded to: {filePath}");
    }
